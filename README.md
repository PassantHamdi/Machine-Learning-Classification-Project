# Machine-Learning-Classification-Project

Your team leader requests from you build a classifier for the articles that can use in the recommendation. In addition to, grouping the articles under each category into multiple groups, for example:
Articles with the Engineering category will be grouped into 4 groups each group with a dummy name e.g. group1, group2, ... etc.

group1 will be mapped into software design
group2 will be mapped into mobile development
......

You are responsible only for the grouping, they need only:
Engineering
group1 = [Article#1, Article#5, Article#9, ... etc.]
group2 = [Article#2, Article#15, Article#91, ... etc.]
group3 = [Article#10, Article#25, Article#90, ... etc.]
group4 = [Article#11, Article#4, Article#6, ... etc.]

and other categories.

Feel free to choose your classification algorithm and all the pre-processing needed on the data.

The team shares with you this JSON file (Note: "JSON" text is clickable) for a group of categorized articles as you will divide those articles into 3 groups: training data, validating data, and testing data.

To measure the accuracy of each algorithm, at this level you will measure the accuracy by the percent of matching only.
